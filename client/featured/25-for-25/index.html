remember the impact it had on me when i first watched it on a laptop while laying down on the foot of my bed in like sophomore, actually prob junior, year of high school. i was so entranced i didnt move an inch. right now, i can still call myself back to that specific emotion it solicited in me‚Ä¶ it was a constant wave of complicated, heavy, uncompromised, brutal, beauty. i&#x27;ve watched it a

the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the¬†<i>new</i>. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau&#x27;s famous motto, &quot;Anyone can cook.&quot; But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist<i>can</i>¬†come from<i>anywhere</i>. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau&#x27;s, who is, in this critic&#x27;s opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France. I will be returning to Gusteau&#x27;s soon, hungry for more.</blockquote><p>what a life affirming film. i will always cherish it üêÄüë®‚Äçüç≥</p><h2>10. <a href="https://boxd.it/Arw0">Aftersun</a></h2><p>ok this is the highest ranked movie that ive only watched once. and i watched it on an airplane. if you&#x27;ve seen it, then you can prob picture me hiding in my hoodie letting tears run down my face while the flight attendant asked if i wanted any water or biscoff cookies. i did cannot do justice to how well paced this movie is. there are a few other films on this list that similarly lure the audience in with their pacing, but i&#x27;ve never found myself as hypnotized as i did watching Afterson. i do not recall empathizing with a character so deeply in this manner‚Ä¶ feeling all of his broken and unsatisfied soul, aware of time fleeting away, understanding the love he undoubtably carries for his daughter, watching him summon all of the remain will he has to try to make some sort of impact on someone he cares about, but ever-so-slowly recognizing he doesn&#x27;t have enough left to give‚Ä¶ and he knows it. ugh but watching a person who&#x27;s given up on the world not only find, but summon the spirit to seek out, the occasional moment that justifies him still being here experiencing life and love‚Ä¶ its just too much man lol anytime this movie comes up, the fact that it was director Charlotte Wells&#x27;<!-- --> <b><i>first movie ever</i></b> <!-- -->is worth bringing up bc omg wtf idk what else to say</p><h2>11. <a href="https://boxd.it/pUfA">Dune: Part 2</a></h2><p>i dont think ive ever written anything significant abt Dune, which is an unusual thing for me to (not) do when i love something to the extent that i love Dune. the movies both fuck (and so will Messiah, fuck the doubters + trust in Villeneuve&#x27;s vision), and the books are among my all-time favorites (mandatorily acknowledging that i dont read much ngl). this might be another example of the &quot;Parasite Effect&quot;, a term that i just made up. it occurs when i&#x27;m just so passionate abt the themes explored and fully aligned with the critiques levelled in films (those akin to Parasite/Dune), and its hard for me to refrain from just saying &quot;hell yeah&quot; or simply listing all the things i love abt them. someday i&#x27;ll get around to writing more thoughtfully abt Dune, but today is, yet again, not that day.</p><p>anyways, here r my fav books (fiction) (unordered):</p><ul><i><li>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus</li><li>The Dispossessed</li><li>Things Fall Apart</li><li>Dune</li></i></ul><p><i>(i like sci-fi)</i></p><h2>12. <a href="https://boxd.it/1JzG">Inglourious Basterds</a></h2><p>was my fav movie throughout high school and i&#x27;m very due to watch it again. my fav tarantino + fuck nazis‚Ä¶ its undeniable how entrenched some of these scenes/set-pieces are in the minds of everyone who watched them. that feat alone is incredibly special, but this movie&#x27;s sum is still greater than its parts‚Ä¶ just kind of like a masterclass i suppose lol also: excuse my language, but quentin stop being a little self-righteous bitch and just make another movie y r u more worried abt ur legacy than just making a movie abt whatever ur into at the time? u made a dumb rule for yourself and ur the only one who cares anddd well yeah i just like want u to get over yourself bc u make great movies. not to mention ur wrong to universally criticize the later career works of directors: not only have ppl like Miyazaki and Scorsese both made ur theory look stupid as hell in the past couple of years, and those r just examples off the dome. do whatever u want, i guess, i dont have any right to demand something from an artist, but damn dude i do not understand ur mindset rn</p><h2>13. <a href="https://boxd.it/7bQA">Whiplash</a></h2><p>ur so pressed abt whether ur rushing or dragging, but when was the last time u asked urself why the fuck you give such a shit? do you even remember when you stopped loving the thing that u spend every waking moment perfecting? are you aware that you&#x27;re never going to be able to? are you scared? do you need ur abusive teacher just as much as he needs you? do u feel more at ease with someone pushing you harder than ur capable of being pushed? how have you fallen so deeply into obsession? or, why are you so scared of no longer being able to indulge urself in this obsession that u make a father-figure out of a man whose been broken it? there is no perfecting it, you&#x27;re now only capable of seeking satisfaction through the same cycle of trauma that&#x27;s broken the fools that went down this path before you. cmon, miles. let&#x27;s just go to the movies or something.. oooo i love this movie. in the pantheon of the *director-makes-movie-about-how-self-destructive-it-is-to-make-movies* subgenre (and since its Damien Chazelle, obviously the metaphor for filmmaking is jazz music). the ending is maybe(?) misinterpreted by some ppl, but omg is it devastating‚Ä¶</p><h2>14. <a href="https://boxd.it/2b1M">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a></h2><p>this movie blew away my expectations‚Ä¶ what i was anticipating would&#x27;ve been dope too but i mean cmon now. no one expects something of this magnitude going into a first-time viewing of any film. i was aware of the prestige and universal acclaim, but this is truly an epic in every sense of the word.</p><p>to briefly touch on the fight scenes, they fucking float lol. the moment in the<!-- --> <a href="https://youtu.be/ltY3ZLA6dA8?si=1ndg1AeQyZkaYibg">initial showdown</a> <!-- -->between Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh where they both just take off into the air holy shit its an &quot;omg i love the movies&quot; moment. it instantly communicates the enchanting/romantic nature of these mythic martial artists and their mastery over the craft. and it looks cool as fuckkk</p><p>so the leads of this movie (Ziyi, Yeoh, and Chow Yun-Fat) play maybe the three coolest people to ever exist? all of them deliver phenomenal performances, but its impossible not to key in on Zhang Ziyi. as a 20 year old, she&#x27;s trusted with large chunks of a film that also features two of asia&#x27;s most renown/beloved actors. needless to say, Ziyi was more than up to the task (lol her character is also just so cool this movie is so cool)</p><p>there&#x27;s a lot that contributes to the magic of this movie (too much to try and list rn), but my fav theme is the suppression of desire between Yeoh and Yun-Fat&#x27;s characters. i&#x27;m not going to spoil, but if you&#x27;ve seen it you know the vibe. what a banger</p><h2>15. <a href="https://boxd.it/k4BO">The Brutalist</a></h2><blockquote>My buildings were designed to endure such erosion.</blockquote><p>a self-indulgent, uncompromised 3 hour epic about the lie at the core of the american dream, how capitalism shackles artists, escapism thru drugs (and fucking zionism), the inability of the bourgeois class to engage with art‚Ä¶ idk its just all very up my alley. oh and it took fucking risks!</p><p><i>very thought-provoking<!-- --> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2fUO43K5JsFtCT1bWbcoFp?si=ug-ZU6NMQ028i6zAxUXL_w">Big Picture episode featuring Adam Nayman</a></i></p><h2>16. <a href="https://boxd.it/1Y2i">Children of Men</a></h2><p>lol if The Brutalist was &quot;up my alley&quot;, this movie features<!-- --> <a href="https://youtu.be/wrALRx95mHs?si=5nY18gnUy8ByZVA0">this scene</a>. its unbearable how relevant this film is specifically in regard to america&#x27;s despicable treatment of immigrants (illegal, legal, whatever it shouldn&#x27;t matter they&#x27;re ppl like holy shit have some empathy). the filmmaking in this is maybe the best of the century?
