          prob junior, year of high school. i was so entranced i didnt move an
          inch. right now, i can still call myself back to that specific emotion
          it solicited in me‚Ä¶ it was a constant wave of complicated, heavy,
          uncompromised, brutal, beauty. i've watched it a few times since, but

          In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet
          enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves
          to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to
          write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that
          in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably
          more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are
          times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the
          discovery and defense of the¬†<i>new</i>. The world is often unkind to
          new talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I
          experienced something new: an extraordinary meal from a singularly
          unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have
          challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross
          understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have
          made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto, "Anyone
          can cook." But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he
          meant. Not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist¬†
          <i>can</i>¬†come from¬†
          <i>anywhere</i>. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than
          those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's
          opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France. I will be
          returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more.

          ok this is the highest ranked movie that ive only watched once. and i

          picture me hiding in my hoodie letting tears run down my face while
          the flight attendant asked if i wanted any water or biscoff cookies. i
          did cannot do justice to how well paced this movie is. there are a few
          other films on this list that similarly lure the audience in with
          their pacing, but i've never found myself as hypnotized as i did
          watching Afterson. i do not recall empathizing with a character so
          deeply in this manner‚Ä¶ feeling all of his broken and unsatisfied soul,
          aware of time fleeting away, understanding the love he undoubtably
          carries for his daughter, watching him summon all of the remain will
          he has to try to make some sort of impact on someone he cares about,
          but ever-so-slowly recognizing he doesn't have enough left to give‚Ä¶
          and he knows it. ugh but watching a person who's given up on the world
          not only find, but summon the spirit to seek out, the occasional
          moment that justifies him still being here experiencing life and love‚Ä¶

          among my all-time favorites (mandatorily acknowledging that i dont
          read much ngl). this might be another example of the "Parasite
          Effect", a term that i just made up. it occurs when i'm just so
          passionate abt the themes explored and fully aligned with the
          critiques levelled in films (those akin to Parasite/Dune), and its
          hard for me to refrain from just saying "hell yeah" or simply listing
          all the things i love abt them. someday i'll get around to writing

          suppose lol also: excuse my language, but quentin stop being a little

          between Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh where they both just take off
          into the air holy shit its an "omg i love the movies" moment. it
          instantly communicates the enchanting/romantic nature of these mythic
          martial artists and their mastery over the craft. and it looks cool as
          fuckkk

        <p>
          so the leads of this movie (Ziyi, Yeoh, and Chow Yun-Fat) play maybe
          the three coolest people to ever exist? all of them deliver phenomenal
          performances, but its impossible not to key in on Zhang Ziyi. as a 20
          year old, she's trusted with large chunks of a film that also features
          two of asia's most renown/beloved actors. needless to say, Ziyi was
          more than up to the task (lol her character is also just so cool this
          movie is so cool)

        <p>
          there's a lot that contributes to the magic of this movie (too much to

          between Yeoh and Yun-Fat's characters. i'm not going to spoil, but if
          you've seen it you know the vibe. what a banger
